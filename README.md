miscellaneous scripts and profile to use when e.g. starting up a fresh vm

## user-setup.sh
- creates a user 'brian', adds it to the 'sudo' group, and sets up a bash prompt and some basic aliases
- run as root on the initial login to a new vm
- perhaps do something like `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swixi/scripts/main/user-setup.sh | bash`
