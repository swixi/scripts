nc -l <port>
  check if port is in use

netstat -tulpn
  scan ports on local machine

nmap -sV --script vulners <hostname> 
  run the nmap vulnerabilities script against hostname
  hostname can be remote or localhost
  localhost will find open ports that might be protected by a firewall (compare running the nmap locally vs remotely)
  https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/vulners.html
  can add '-v' for verbose

nmap --script vuln <hostname>
  I believe this runs all of the vulnerabilities scripts in the link above
